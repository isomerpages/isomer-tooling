## Isomer Tooling Repo

This repo contains some handy tools for the Administrators of the Isomer project.

### Update Repo Files

The `update-repo-files` tool ensures that all Isomer repos have a consistent standard set of files (e.g. `.ruby-version`, `.gitignore`, `Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock`). For more details, refer to the README in the `update-repo-files` folder.
